Pseudocode:

Single round game:

Loop first round in case of draw:
    Take input from Player One about their choice in Rock, Paper, Scissors and store it in a variable (p1Choice)
    Take input from Player Two about their choice in Rock, Paper, Scissors and store it in a variable (p2Choice)

    If Player One chose rock AND Player Two chose paper:
        Output Player Two Wins
    Else if Player One chose rock AND Player Two chose scissors:
        Output Player One Wins
    Else if Player One chose paper AND Player Two chose scissors
        Output Player Two Wins
    Else if Player One chose paper AND Player Two chose rock:
        Output Player One Wins
    Else if Player One Chose scissors AND Player Two chose rock:
        Output Player Two Wins
    Else if Player One Chose scissors AND Player Two chose paper:
        Output Player One Wins
    Else:
        Output Draw
        restart round loop
    Break the round loop (this will occur if there is no draw)

Best 4 out of 7 game:

Create variable for Player One round wins (p1Wins) and set it to 0
Create variable for Player Two round wins (p2Wins) and set it to 0
Create variable for the round number (roundNum) and set it to 0


Loop rounds while Player One has less than 4 wins AND while Player Two has less than 4 wins:
    Increment roundNum

    Loop round infinitely in case of draw:
        Take input from Player One about their choice in Rock, Paper, Scissors and store it in a variable (p1Choice)
        Take input from Player Two about their choice in Rock, Paper, Scissors and store it in a variable (p2Choice)
        
        If Player One chose rock AND Player Two chose paper:
            Output Player Two Wins round <roundNum>
            Increment p2Wins
        Else if Player One chose rock AND Player Two chose scissors:
            Output Player One Wins round <roundNum>
            Increment p1Wins
        Else if Player One chose paper AND Player Two chose scissors
            Output Player Two Wins round <roundNum>
            Increment p1Wins
        Else if Player One chose paper AND Player Two chose rock:
            Output Player One Wins round <roundNum>
            Increment p1Wins
        Else if Player One Chose scissors AND Player Two chose rock:
            Output Player Two Wins round <roundNum>
            Increment p1Wins
        Else if Player One Chose scissors AND Player Two chose paper:
            Output Player One Wins round <roundNum>
            Increment p1Wins
        Else:
            Output Draw
            restart round loop
        Break the round loop
If p1Wins is 4:
    Output Player 1 wins
Else:
    Output Player 2 wins

Code I used to check

roundNum, p1Wins, p2Wins = 0,0,0

while(p1Wins < 4 and p2Wins < 4):
    roundNum+=1
    print("This is round",roundNum)

    while(True):
        p1Choice = str(input("p1: "))
        p2Choice = str(input("p2: "))

        if p1Choice == "rock" and p2Choice == "paper":
            print("Player 2 wins round",roundNum)
            p2Wins+=1
        elif p1Choice == "rock" and p2Choice == "scissors":
            print("Player 1 wins round",roundNum)
            p1Wins+=1
        elif p1Choice == "paper" and p2Choice == "scissors":
            print("Player 2 wins round",roundNum)
            p2Wins+=1
        elif p1Choice == "paper" and p2Choice == "rock":
            print("Player 1 wins round",roundNum)
            p1Wins+=1
        elif p1Choice == "scissors" and p2Choice == "rock":
            print("Player 2 wins round",roundNum)
            p2Wins+=1
        elif p1Choice == "scissors" and p2Choice == "paper":
            print("Player 1 wins round",roundNum)
            p1Wins+=1
        else:
            print("Draw")
            continue
        break

print("Player 1 wins") if p1Wins == 4 else print("Player 2 wins")
