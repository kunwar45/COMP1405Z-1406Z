        #b) Retrieve the tf-idfs of the unique words in the phrase for every document
    #Step 2: Find cosine similarity of the phrase and every page
        #a) For each document:
                #- For each term in the query vector, multiply it's query tfidf with the document tfidf of that term
                #- Add these values up from all the terms
            #- Divide the summed up value by the product of the euclidean norm of the query multiplied by the euclidean norm of the document
    #Step 3: Multiply by pageRank is boost is True
